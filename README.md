# Devoteam XL-Deploy/XL-Release KISS

This session will go through the basics of XL-Deploy and XL-Release. We'll use a Tomcat server to deploy the application. XL-Deploy, XL-Release and Tomcat are installed on a Alpine Linux VM using VirtualBox. 

## 1. Pre-requisites

* [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Internet Browser, like Chrome, Firefox or Edge

That's it! :) You can use a SSH Terminal like Putty to login to the VM, if you prefer it over using VirtualBox itself.

## 2. Architecture

![alt text](./Images/VM_archtecture.png)

Alpine hosts all applications used in this session. Tomcat is installed on the VM, while XL-Deploy and XL-Release are available as docker containers(with data persistence on the VM). The VM is available as an appliance you can import in your VirtualBox. The appliance also takes care of the port mapping, so you can access the applications using **"localhost:\<portNumber\>"**

## 3. Getting Started

### Import VM as Appliance
Follow [these](https://www.maketecheasier.com/import-export-ova-files-in-virtualbox/) instructions to import the VM as an appliance(*.ova).

### Credentials
* VM 
    * User: root
    * Password: devoteam2019
* XL-Deploy/XL-Release:
    * User: Admin
    * Password: devoteam2019

### URLs
* Tomcat: http://localhost:8080
* XL-Deploy: http://localhost:4516
* XL-Release: http://localhost:5516
* SSH VM: localhost:22
* Docker Ip\*: 172.17.0.1

\*The "Docker Ip" is used to connect the containers and Tomcat over the network.

## 4. Start VM and its applications
1. Start the VM
1. Login to the VM using VirtualBox or a SSH Terminal (Check the **[Credentials](#credentials)** chapter above)
1. Execute the following command to get the "CONTAINER ID"s to start XL-Deploy and XL-Release in the next step:  
`docker ps -a`  
![alt text](./Images/StartContainers.png)
1. Start both containers using the following command:  
`docker start <containerId>`
1. The applications should become available in a minute or two.

## 5. Let's do it!
Before we start, it's important to know that each entry in XL-Deploy is known as a `Configuration Item` or `CI`. So each defined application, application version, environment, host, etc is a `CI`.

#### XL-Deploy: First Deployment
We going to the following:
1. Import the `PetClinic` application to deploy
1. Define the `Tomcat` infrastructure
1. Define an environment we can deploy to
1. First Deployment of `PetClinic`
1. Rollback a version of `PetClinic`

##### Application
Import the `PetClinic` application, so you can deploy it.
1. Login to [XL-Deploy](http://localhost:4516)
1. Click on the `...` next to `Applications`, then go to `Import` > `From XL Deploy Server`
1. Select `PetClinic-war/1.0` and click `Import`
1. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for package `PetClinic-war/2.0`
1. You should be able to see this:

##### Infrastructure
We need to define the `Tomcat` infrastructure, so XL-Deploy knows where to deploy the `PetClinic` application.  
We'll start by defining the target host first:  
1. Click on the `...` next to `Infrastructure`, then go to `New` > `overthere` > `SshHost`
1. Fill in the following:
    * Name: `TomcatHost`
    * Operating system: `Unix`
    * Connection Type: `SCP`
    * Address: `172.17.0.1`
    * Port: `22`
    * Username: `root`
    * Password: `devoteam2019`
1. Click on `Save and close`
1. Click on the `...` next to `TomcatHost`, then go to `Check connection`
1. Click on `Execute` to verify the connection to our `Tomcat` host. If the verify is successful, click on `Finish`

Now we're going to define the Tomcat instance, so XL-Deploy knows where the `Tomcat` is installed on the target host.
1. Click on the `...` next to `TomcatHost`, then go to `New` > `tomcat` > `Server`
1. Fill in the following:
    * Name: `TomcatInstance`
    * Home: `/usr/local/tomcat/apache-tomcat-9.0.17`
    * Start Command: `/usr/local/tomcat/apache-tomcat-9.0.17/bin/startup.sh`
    * Stop Command: `/usr/local/tomcat/apache-tomcat-9.0.17/bin/shutdown.sh`
1. Click on `Save and close`

Last step in the infrastructure is to define where the applications need to be deployed.
1. Click on the `...` next to `TomcatInstance`, then go to `New` > `tomcat` > `VirtualHost`
1. Fill in the following:
    * Name: `TomcatPetClinic`
1. Click on `Save and close`

The end result should look like this:  
![alt text](./Images/XLD_DefineInfrastructure.png)

#### Environment
An environment is nothing more than a grouping of one or more Infrastructure `CI`s you can deploy to. Your environment will only contain the `TomcatInstance` `CI`.

1. Click on the `...` next to `Environments`, then go to `New` > `Environment`
1. Fill in the following:
    * Name: `Production` (because that's how we roll)
    * Containers: `Infrastructure/TomcatHost/TomcatInstance/TomcatPetClinic`
1. Click on `Save and close`

#### First Deployment
Finally we can deploy. 

1. First check if you get a `HTTP 404` error when opening [PetClinic](http://localhost:8080/petclinic/) in your browser
1. In `XL-Deploy` click on the big `Start a deployment` button in the center:  
![alt text](./Images/XLD_StartDeployment.png)
1. Drag and drop the following:
    * `Applications/PetClinic-war/1.0` to `Drag and drop package here`
    * `Environments/Production` to `Drag and drop environment here`
1. Click on `Preview` to see what tasks XL-Deploy will execute to deploy `PetClinic`
1. Click on `Close preview` to return to the previous view
1. Click on `Deploy` and `PetClinic` should be deployed in seconds
1. Go to [PetClinic](http://localhost:8080/petclinic/) and browse the application:  
![alt text](./Images/Tomcat_PetClinicV1.png)
1. Go back to `XL-Deploy` and click on `Finish`. This will tell XL-Deploy you accept this deployment. 

#### Rollback
What if you just deployed a version of `PetClinic` in production, but you want to revert after browsing or testing? Here we going to do just that.

1. In `XL-Deploy` click on the big `Start a deployment` button in the center:  
![alt text](./Images/XLD_StartDeployment.png)
1. Drag and drop the following:
    * `Applications/PetClinic-war/2.0` to `Drag and drop package here`
    * `Environments/Production` to `Drag and drop environment here`
1. Click on `Preview` and you can see that a task called `Destroy petclinic on TomcatPetClinic` has been added.
1. Click on `Close preview` to return to the previous view
1. Click on `Deploy` and `PetClinic` should be deployed in seconds. 
1. Go to [PetClinic](http://localhost:8080/petclinic/). You see that the image on the homepage has been changed (if not: refresh the page):  
![alt text](./Images/Tomcat_PetClinicV2.png)
1. Let's say we won't accept this change in `PetClinic` and we want a rollback. Go back to `XL-Deploy` and click on `Rollback`, then `Yes`. 
1. Go back to [PetClinic](http://localhost:8080/petclinic/) and refresh the page. The image should revert to this:  
![alt text](./Images/Tomcat_PetClinicV1.png)
1. Go back to `XL-Deploy` and click on `Finish` to accept the deployment. Should you want to rollback after accepting a deployment, you can always start a new one.

#### XL-Release: First Release


#### XL-Deploy: Reporting


#### XL-Deploy: Tagging
